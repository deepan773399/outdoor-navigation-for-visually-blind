NAVIGATION THROUGH UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENT IS A CHALLENGING TASK FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED . MAIN PROBLEMS THAT AFFECT A PERSONâ€™S ABILITY TO NAVIGATE ARE 1.WHAT IS THE OBSTACLES ARROUND THEM , 2.HOW FAR THE OBSTACLE IS AND 3. IN WHICH DIRECTION THE OBSTACLE LIES. SO IF HE/SHE KNOW ABOUT OBSTACLE ARROUND AND ABOUT ITS LOCATION THAN HE/SHE CAN NAVIGATE ARROUND WITH LESS DIFFICULTIES. SO OUR MAIN PROBLEM IS TO RECOGNIZE THE OBJECT , DISTANCE OF OBJECT FROM CAMERA AND ANGLE AT WHICH OBJECT IS LOCATED FROM THE CENTRE OF THE SCREEN. WE CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM EFFECTIVELY USING VISION LEARNING BUT HERE WE ONLY USES IMAGE PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING .
